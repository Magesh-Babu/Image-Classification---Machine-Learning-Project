# Image-Classification---Machine-Learning-Project

This project is focused on classifying handwritten digits (0 to 9) utilizing the well-known MNIST datasets. Multiple machine learning models were trained and assessed for this purpose. Following successful training, the model was deployed within a Streamlit application, enabling real-time digit recognition.
